This is a program for opening a raw radiofrequency ultrasound dataset, which is available at: 
https://mosmed.ai/datasets/ultrasound_doppler_twinkling_artifact. 
The dataset contains complex raw radiofrequency signals received from the output of the beamformer 
of the Sonomed-500 medical ultrasonic scanner. The signals were obtained using the Gammex flow-through 
phantom and are intended for debugging and testing the performance of Doppler signal processing algorithms. 
The dataset also contains signals obtained using phantoms with microcalcifications and solid metal and 
plastic objects, these signals can be used for studying the Doppler twinkling artifact.

The dataset opener is available at: 
https://github.com/Center-of-Diagnostics-and-Telemedicine/TwinklingDatasetDisplay.git 

The dataset opener works with a special library called XRAD, which is available at: 
https://github.com/Center-of-Diagnostics-and-Telemedicine/xrad.git

Keywords: twinkling artifact, Doppler ultrasound, color flow imaging, raw radio-frequency signals, phantoms.

Terms of use: 
anyone is free to share (copy, distribute, and transmit) and to remix (adapt and make derivative works) the dataset 
and its opener as long as appropriate credit is given to the authors.
